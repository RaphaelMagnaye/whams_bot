            .setDescription(`The WHAM game involves two roles: WHAMER and WHAMED.
            The WHAMER can choose to WHAM! anybody that is not currently WHAMED.
            There is a 40% chance that the WHAMER will successfully WHAM! the target, and a 60% failure rate.
            
            To WHAM! somebody:

            w!wham <person>

            The person can be either tagged in the message or match the person's display name.

            To obtain the WHAMER role:
            There is a 1% chance that you receive a WHAM charge per message you send in chat.
            There is a 5% chance that a message sent will trigger a toss-up event. Reacting to it gives you a WHAM charge.

            Upon success:
            When you succeed in WHAMing someone, the person is now WHAMED, loses all their current WHAM! tokens, and you keep your current WHAM charge.

            Upon failure:
            When you fail to WHAM somebody, you lose your WHAM charge and pass it along to the person you
            attempted to WHAM.

            Resetting the WHAM! game:
            As of current moment, you may run the w!whamreset command to reset the game.
            This command is limited to OG Whams Members and above.

            Listing WHAMED, WHAMERs, or NEITHER:

            w!list [WHAMED/WHAMER/NEITHER]

            Returns a list of people who are either whamed, whamers, or neither.

            Returns whether a specified person is WHAMED, a WHAMER, or NEITHER. Leaving out the Person argument checks yourself.

            Checking someone's stats

            Returns the stats of the specified person.
